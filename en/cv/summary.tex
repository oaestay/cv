Current Software Engineer in Notus, a company that develops and implements solutions based in optimization and simulation for business management. My main tasks are the development of web applications, optimization models and simulation models. My specialty is algorithm design and implementation, and backend development; but I certainly love to learn and work the latest technologies not only in backend, but also in frontend and mobile. I also have experience with a variety of frameworks (mostly web frameworks), databases and tools, such as Vue, NodeJS, Django, Ruby on Rails, LAMP, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Docker, Amazon AWS.

I'm interested in developing solutions for concrete problems, of diverse complexity, using modern technologies and best coding practices so that they remain being used for a long period of time.
